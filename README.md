# 🚀 100 Days of Code — Python Bootcamp Projects

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code — Python Bootcamp** journey! 💻✨  
This repository contains all the mini-projects, exercises, and challenges that I've completed while learning Python through **Dr. Angela Yu's Python Bootcamp on Udemy**.

## 📅 What This Repo Is About

This is a structured journey where each day focuses on a different Python concept. Each folder represents a day, and inside it contains the key tasks, coding exercises, and major projects for that day.

The goal is to progressively build my Python skills from beginner to advanced by practicing real-world coding problems.

## 🔥 What You'll Find Here

| Day  | Topic                          | Project/Focus                           |
|------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Day 8 | Functions with Parameters       | Caesar Cipher (Encryption/Decryption)   |
| Day 9 | Dictionaries & Nesting          | Secret Auction Program                  |
| Day 10 | Functions with Outputs         | Name Formatter, Email Generator, Leap Year Checker (Ongoing) |

---

## ✨ Highlights So Far
- ✅ Built an interactive **Caesar Cipher app** that encrypts and decrypts messages.
- ✅ Designed a **Secret Auction Program** that collects bids and announces the winner.
- ✅ Created functions with **outputs**, including tools like a **name formatter**, **email generator**, and a **Leap Year Checker**.

## 💡 Skills I'm Practicing
- Functions (with parameters, outputs, nesting)
- Dictionaries and nested data structures
- String manipulation
- Loops and conditionals
- Writing clean and reusable code

## 📚 **Contents**

### 🗝️ **Day 8 — Caesar Cipher Project**
- **Concepts:** 
  - Functions with inputs.
  - Arguments and parameters.
  - Loops inside functions.
- **Project:** 
  - **Caesar Cipher Encoder & Decoder**
  - Allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters in the alphabet.
  - Handles shifts greater than the alphabet length.
  - Keeps non-letter characters unchanged (like spaces, numbers, punctuation).

---

### 🗺️ **Day 9 — Secret Auction Program**
- **Concepts:**
  - Working with dictionaries.
  - Nesting lists and dictionaries.
  - Looping through dictionaries.
- **Project:**
  - **Silent Auction System**
  - Collects bids from multiple users without revealing the highest bidder until the end.
  - Determines the highest bid and winner.
  - Handles ties in bids.
  - Practical use of loops, conditions, and dictionaries.

---

### 🔥 **Day 10 — Functions with Outputs + Calculator**
- **Concepts:**
  - Functions with return values.
  - Multiple functions in one program.
  - Nested functions (functions within functions).
  - Docstrings and documentation.
- **Projects:**
  - **Name Formatter:** Formats user names properly.
  - **Leap Year Checker:** Checks if a given year is a leap year.
  - **Simple Calculator:** Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Focus on reusability of functions and clean code organization.

---

## 🎯 **Skills Practiced**
- Functions with parameters and return values.
- Looping through lists and dictionaries.
- Error handling (invalid inputs).
- Clean code writing and function documentation.
- Simple algorithm logic for real-world problems.

---

## ✅ **How to Run These Projects**
- Open the Python files or Colab notebooks.
- Run the cells, follow the input prompts, and see the outputs.
- You can test by changing the input values.
